## 🌍 UN Sustainable Development Goal Addressed
- **Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns**  
  Brechó aligns with **UN SDG 12** by promoting a platform for second-hand clothing sales, encouraging sustainable fashion practices, and reducing textile waste. Additionally, it supports local sellers and fosters a circular economy.

## 📜 Project Description
Brechó is a web-based platform designed to tackle the challenges of fast fashion and excessive clothing waste. It provides a space for users to sell, buy, or exchange used clothing that would otherwise be discarded. Inspired by the Portuguese word *brechó*, meaning "thrift store," the project seeks to reduce environmental impacts and promote sustainable consumer behavior.

The website includes features such as:
- Easy listing of second-hand clothes.
- A clean and user-friendly interface for browsing items.
- Search filters for categories, sizes, and prices.
- Information about sustainable fashion and its benefits.

By empowering users to make conscious clothing choices, Brechó contributes to reducing waste, conserving resources, and supporting responsible production and consumption.
